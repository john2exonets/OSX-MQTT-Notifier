# OSX Notifier

Watches for MQTT messages that start with 'alert/' and pushes the message to the OSX Notification Center. This creates a Notification and also playes a sound.  It also watches for "High Winds" from my weather station.

Several sensors in my Smart Home send out alert conditions that are picked up by some of my computers and displayed on the screen.
